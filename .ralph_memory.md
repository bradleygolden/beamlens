# Ralph Memory

## Active Work
- PR #1: Binary Leak Detection (awaiting review)

## Completed
- Binary Leak Detection - Implemented beam_binary_leak and beam_binary_top_memory callbacks

## Queue
- Next: Message Queue Overload (HIGH)
- Next: Scheduler Utilization (HIGH)
- Next: System Monitor Events (HIGH)

## Patterns
- Use :erlang.memory(:binary) for leak detection
- Process.info/2 for queue lengths and binary info
- Force GC with :erlang.garbage_collect() to measure deltas
