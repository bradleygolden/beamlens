## Active Work
- Binary Leak Detection (implementing - PR not yet created)

## Completed
- None yet

## Queue
- Next: Message Queue Overload (HIGH)
- Next: Scheduler Utilization (HIGH)
- Next: System Monitor Events (HIGH)

## Patterns
- Use :erlang.memory(:binary) for leak detection
- Process.info/2 for queue lengths and binary info
- Force GC with :erlang.garbage_collect() to measure deltas
