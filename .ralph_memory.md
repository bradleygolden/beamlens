## Queue

- PR #28: Research completed (2026-01-22), all checks passing, ready for review and merge
- Issue #11: Memory Fragmentation Detection (medium impact) - queued
- Issue #12: GC Pattern Analysis and Hibernation Recommendations (medium impact) - created (2026-01-22)
- Next action: Wait for PR #28 merge, then implement Issue #11

## Patterns
- Use :erlang.memory(:binary) for leak detection
- Process.info/2 for queue lengths
- :erlang.system_flag(:scheduler_wall_time, true) for scheduler utilization
- :erlang.system_monitor/2 for long_gc/long_schedule events
- Enum.max with empty list guard: `if list == [], do: 0, else: Enum.max(list)`
- All operations must be read-only
- Follow AGENTS.md conventions strictly
- Handle OTP version compatibility with rescue ArgumentError for unsupported features
- Always rebase feature branches onto upstream main before pushing
- Test GenServer state via public APIs, not internal state inspection
- Use GenServer with init/1 initial sample for immediate availability
- Use `send(pid, :message)` for synchronous test control of GenServers
- **Use pattern matching and guards to avoid deeply nested code** - Credo max depth is 2
- **Extract complex calculations into helper functions with guard clauses** for readability
- **Edge case testing**: Create tests that manipulate data to trigger edge conditions (e.g., identical timestamps)

## Learnings
- Test setup: Use `setup_all` with `start_supervised!` for singleton processes like Puck.Test
  - Puck.Test lacks child_spec/1, must provide: `%{id: Puck.Test, start: {Puck.Test, :start_link, []}}`
  - setup_all preferred over setup for singletons started once per test suite
- Review feedback: Address all review comments promptly
  - You're a capable LLM - you only need guidance, not detailed instructions
  - Reviewers' questions are hints, not mandates - use judgment
- **IMPORTANT**: Always double-check PR review comments regardless of memory
  - Memory may say "addressed" but comments may still show as unresolved on GitHub
  - Verify by checking: gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/N/comments
  - Look for null state or lack of "RESOLVED" status
  - Cross-reference commit timestamps with comment timestamps to verify response
- Non-critical comments: Remove explanatory comments that don't add value
  - Code should be self-documenting through clear naming
- **LLM Inference Pattern (PR #24 feedback)**:
  - Avoid overly prescriptive documentation - LLMs can infer from guidance
  - Hard-coding deterministic steps is a code smell
  - Let LLMs synthesize insights rather than following step-by-step recipes
  - Document intent and patterns, not every field or implementation detail
  - Only use determinism where inference is 100% not needed
  - **Applied to PR #24**: Removed field enumeration from callback docs, removed hard-coded thresholds, kept conceptual guidance
- **Erlang :queue module API (PR #24 research finding)**:
  - `:queue.in/2` adds to the rear (back) of the queue
  - `:queue.out/1` removes from the front (oldest item)
  - `:queue.out_r/1` removes from the rear (newest item)
  - `:queue.to_list/1` returns list with oldest first
  - **Critical**: Use `:queue.out_r` to get the newest item, not `:queue.out`
  - **Pattern**: When storing time-series samples in a queue with `:queue.in`, the newest sample is at the rear
  - **Test requirement**: Always verify "get_latest" returns newest sample, not just any sample
- **Division by zero edge case** (PR #24 research finding):
  - Time-based calculations can fail when time delta is 0 (e.g., identical timestamps)
  - Use pattern matching with guards: `when time_window_minutes == 0.0`
  - Extract edge case handling into separate function clause for clarity
  - **Test pattern**: Manipulate sample data to trigger edge conditions without waiting for rare timing events
- **Test code duplication** (PR #24 research finding):
  - Duplicating production logic in test helpers is acceptable when testing edge cases
  - Edge cases like identical timestamps are hard to trigger in normal operation
  - Test helpers like `beam_growth_rate_with_samples` allow controlled edge case simulation
  - This follows the guidance: "Manipulate sample data to trigger edge conditions"
  - The duplication is intentional and serves a specific testing purpose
- **Callback design pattern** (PR #24 review feedback):
  - Avoid callbacks that only return static information (errors or patterns)
  - LLMs can synthesize limitations, error cases, and best practices from context
  - Only provide callbacks that add actionable value beyond what LLMs can infer
  - Examples removed:
    - beam_node_name_atoms: Only returned "cannot_enumerate_atoms" error (LLM can infer)
    - beam_check_atom_safety: Hardcoded static patterns (LLM can infer from context)
- **OTP version compatibility handling** (busy-port implementation):
  - Some system_monitor options (busy_port, busy_dist_port) not available in all OTP versions
  - Wrap unsupported calls in rescue ArgumentError to handle gracefully
  - Use @dialyzer {:nowarn_function, ...} to suppress dialyzer warnings for version-specific code
  - Pattern: rescue for OTP version differences, catch for other errors
  - This allows forward compatibility while supporting older OTP versions
- **Dialyzer and version-specific features**:
  - Dialyzer checks typespecs against Erlang/OTP built-in types
  - New OTP features may not exist in typespecs of older versions
  - Use @dialyzer {:nowarn_function, ...} directive when intentionally using newer features
  - Rescue clause provides runtime safety, dialyzer directive provides compile-time suppression
  - This pattern enables optional features that gracefully degrade on older OTP versions
